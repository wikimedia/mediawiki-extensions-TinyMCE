== About ==

TinyMCE is an extension to MediaWiki that allows for using the
open source TinyMCE text editor to edit page contents.

For more information on the TinyMCE extension, see its homepage at

	https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:TinyMCE

== Credits ==

The TinyMCE extension was created by Duncan Crane and Yaron Koren.
Originally it used a significant amount of code from the VisualEditor
extension by Hallo Welt!, which is part of the BlueSpice MediaWiki
package. (Not to be confused with the better-known VisualEditor
extension developed by the Wikimedia Foundation.)

Version 1.0 is almost a complete rewrite of the plugin for TinyMCE 
that translates between html and wiki text.  IT greatly extends the
scope of the editor to as many different wiki text constructs as we 
could find! It also includes anumber of native TinyMCE plugins for 
file uploads, links, tables, citations, editing raw wiki text, 
comments, and a fontawesome plugin.

The majority of the code, though, consists of the TinyMCE editor
itself, which was mostly developed by the Ephox corporation.

Version 1.0 has been extensively and independently tested by
Wikibase bv.

== Basic Installation and setup ==

You can download the TinyMCE extension from:

	https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Special:ExtensionDistributor/TinyMCE.

You can also download the code directly via Git from the MediaWiki 
source code repository, see 

	https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/diffusion/ETMC/tags/master/

From a command line, you can call the following:

	git clone https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/mediawiki/extensions/TinyMCE.git

==Installation==

Please note, this extension is only tested on versions from LTS 1.31, and
may well not work on earlier versions. If you are using MediaWiki 1.27 or
higher, add the following line to your LocalSettings.php file:

	wfLoadExtension( 'TinyMCE' );

For earlier versions, you should call the following instead:

	require_once "$IP/extensions/TinyMCE/TinyMCE.php";

== Configuration ==

The TinyMCE extension comes with a default configuration. You can run the
TinyMCE extension straight 'out of the box 'just by setting
$wgTinyMCEEnabled to 'true' in LocalSettings.php and making it available
to users in their preferrences.

TinyMCE has a very rich configuration environment.  Details of how to 
tailor the default configuration are included on the extension page:
